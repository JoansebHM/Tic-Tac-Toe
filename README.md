## Introduction

Welcome to the Tic Tac Toe Game! This project is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game using the Tkinter graphical user interface in Python. The game allows two players to take turns marking the spaces in a 3x3 grid with their respective symbols ('X' and 'O').

## Features

- Players take turns clicking on the empty spaces to place their symbol ('X' or 'O').
- The game alternates between the two players until there is a winner or a draw.
- To restart the game, click the "Play Again" button.

## Game Rules

- The game follows standard Tic Tac Toe rules.
